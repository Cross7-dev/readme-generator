> This project was born mainly to satisfy my desire for knowledge and to simplify my workflow. Being a curious (and also lazy) developer I have always wondered how avoid to waste my working time to write README.md files who fits perfectly project by project and that's why I wrote a tool to help me simplify and speed up these processes.

## **:wrench: Developer usage**

### **Set up project**

Before cloning the repo **be sure** you have installed:

- [**NODE**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+node) (version >= 9.10.x)
- [**YARN**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+yarn) (version >= 1.9.x)
- [**NPM**](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+install+npm) (version >= 6.3.x)

Then:

- Choose a folder project in your system and switch in `cd [folder path]`
- Clone the repo in your folder `git clone https://github.com/ibbatta/readme-generator.git`

---

### **Installation**

In order to install the project and all dependencies, enter in the project folder and run `yarn install`

---

### Start the project

```bash
yarn start
```

### Test the project

```bash
yarn test
```

---

### **Editor setup**

To keep consistency to the style of resources, I decided to stick to some shared rules that have to be applied to every
project using some editors plugins. Plese be sure to disable / remove any other linters or custom configurations.

I have chosen to use

- [ESLINT](https://www.google.com/search?q=eslint)
- [EDITORCONFIG](https://www.google.com/search?q=editorconfig)
- [JSBEAUTIFY](https://www.google.com/search?q=jsbeautify)
- [PRETTIER](https://www.google.com/search?q=prettier)

This
works including a specific `.dotfile` in the root directory and making sure your editor has the necessary plugin.
