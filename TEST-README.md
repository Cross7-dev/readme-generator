# **README-GENERATOR** (version 0.0.1)

![node version](https://img.shields.io/badge/node->=9.10.x-brightgreen.svg)

> This project was born mainly to satisfy my desire for knowledge and to simplify my workflow. Being a curious (and also lazy) developer I have always wondered how avoid to waste my working time to write README.md files who fits perfectly project by project and that's why I wrote a tool to help me simplify and speed up these processes.

---

### **Editor setup**

To keep consistency to the style of resources, I decided to stick to some shared rules that have to be applied to every
project using some editors plugins. Plese be sure to disable / remove any other js/jsx linters or custom configurations.

#### Eslint

I have chose to use [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) to check on Javascript / React [.js / .jsx] syntax.
It works including a `.eslintrc` file in the root directory and making sure your editor has the necessary plugin.

#### Auto correction on save

I have chose to use [js-beautify](https://github.com/beautify-web/js-beautify/) as a beautifier also for HTML and CSS.
It works including a `.jsbeautifyrc` file in the root directory and making sure your editor has the necessary plugin.

#### Basic Editor Configuration

I have chose to use [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org/) to share the basic configuration like indentation and
charset.
It works including an `.editorconfig` file in the root directory and making sure your editor has the necessary plugin.

#### Prettier

I have chose to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to ensure the codebase with a consistent style.
It works including a `.prettierrc` file in the root directory and making sure your editor has the necessary plugin.
